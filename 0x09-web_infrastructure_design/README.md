Infrastructure Design (Textual Representation):
Server (8.8.8.8):

The physical or virtual machine hosting the entire infrastructure.
Domain Name:

Domain: foobar.com
DNS Record: A record pointing www.foobar.com to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).
Web Server (Nginx):

Handles incoming HTTP requests.
Listens on port 80.
Serves static content, manages SSL/TLS, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Application Server:

Executes the application code.
Communicates with the web server using a specified protocol (e.g., FastCGI).
Application Files (Your Code Base):

Contains the actual code and resources needed to run the website.
Deployed on the application server.
Database (MySQL):

Stores and manages the website's data.
Web server and application server interact with the database using SQL queries.
Role Explanations:
Server:

A computer or system providing services to other computers or devices.
Domain Name:

A human-readable label mapped to an IP address, helping users locate resources on the Internet.

Downtime during Maintenance:

Deploying new code or performing maintenance on the web server may cause downtime as it needs to be restarted.
Scalability Issues:

The infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in traffic. Scaling options like load balancing are not considered in this basic setup.

Infrastructure Design (Textual Representation):
Load-Balancer (HAproxy):

Responsible for distributing incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
Ensures better availability, scalability, and reliability.
Configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm to evenly distribute requests among servers.
Web Servers (Nginx):

Handle incoming HTTP requests.
Serve static content, manage SSL/TLS, and forward dynamic content requests to the application servers.
Increased availability by having two web servers.
Application Server:

Executes the application code.
Processes dynamic content and communicates with the database.
Having a separate application server allows for scalability and easier maintenance.
Application Files (Your Code Base):

Contains the actual code and resources needed to run the website.
Deployed on both application servers to ensure redundancy and load distribution.
Database (MySQL - Primary-Replica Cluster):

Primary Node (Master): Handles write operations and serves as the primary source of data.
Replica Node (Slave): Replicates data from the primary node and handles read operations.
Ensures data availability, fault tolerance, and load distribution.
Role Explanations:

Specifics:
Load-Balancer Algorithm:

Configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm to evenly distribute requests among the two web servers.
Load-Balancer Setup:

Enabling an Active-Active setup where both web servers are actively handling requests. This provides better load distribution and redundancy.
Primary-Replica Cluster:

Primary Node (Master): Handles write operations.
Replica Node (Slave): Replicates data from the primary node and handles read operations.
Issues with this Infrastructure:
Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

The load balancer itself is a single point of failure. If it fails, traffic distribution will be impacted.
Lack of redundancy in the database setup; failure of the primary node can cause service disruptions.
Security Issues:

No mention of a firewall, which can leave the infrastructure vulnerable to unauthorized access.
Lack of HTTPS can expose sensitive data during transmission.
No Monitoring:

Absence of a monitoring system can make it challenging to identify and address performance issues or potential failures promptly.

Infrastructure Design (Textual Representation):
Firewalls (3):

Placed at strategic points to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Act as a barrier between the servers and the internet, enhancing security.
SSL Certificate for HTTPS:

Installed on the load balancer to encrypt the traffic between users and the website.
Ensures secure communication, protecting sensitive data during transmission.
Monitoring Clients (3 - Data Collectors):

Deployed on each server to collect performance metrics and logs.
Provide insights into system health, detect anomalies, and facilitate troubleshooting.
Role Explanations:
Firewalls:

Act as a security measure by filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.
SSL Certificate for HTTPS:

Encrypts data in transit, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user communications.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

Collect performance metrics, logs, and other data to monitor the health and performance of the infrastructure.
Facilitate proactive issue detection, troubleshooting, and capacity planning.
Monitoring Tool Data Collection:
Monitoring Tool:
Utilizes data collectors (Sumologic or similar tools) to gather data from various sources on each server.
Specifics:
Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):
Use the monitoring tool to collect and analyze web server performance metrics, including QPS.
Set up alerts to be notified when QPS exceeds predefined thresholds.
Issues with this Infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer:

May expose unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and backend servers, posing a security risk.
Solution: Encrypt traffic end-to-end or use secure channels between components.
Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Becomes a single point of failure; failure of the MySQL server could lead to service disruptions.
Solution: Implement a MySQL cluster with primary-replica replication for high availability.
Uniform Server Components:

Uniform components may lead to vulnerabilities across the entire infrastructure.
Solution: Implement diversity in server components, ensuring that a vulnerability in one component doesn't affect all servers.
**************************************************


Firewalls (3):

Draw three boxes representing firewalls at strategic points between the servers and the internet.
SSL Certificate for HTTPS:

Draw a lock icon on the line connecting the load balancer and web servers to represent SSL encryption.
Monitoring Clients (3 - Data Collectors):

Draw three icons representing monitoring clients on each server.
Monitoring Tool Data Collection:

Draw arrows from each server pointing towards a central icon representing the monitoring tool, indicating data collection.
Monitoring Web Server QPS:

Draw an arrow from the monitoring tool towards the web server with a label indicating "QPS."
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Draw callout boxes next to the relevant components to represent issues and provide a brief explanation.
