# Role Explanations
- **Firewalls (3):**
  - Act as security barriers, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

- **SSL Certificate for HTTPS:**
  - Encrypts data in transit, ensuring secure communication.

- **Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):**
  - Collect metrics and logs for monitoring system health.

- **Load Balancer:**
  - Distributes traffic, enhances availability, and acts as a termination point for SSL.

- **Database (MySQL Cluster):**
  - Primary Node: Handles write operations.
  - Replica Node: Replicates data for read operations.

# Monitoring Tool Data Collection:
- Utilizes data collectors on each server to gather metrics and logs for analysis.

# Issues with this Infrastructure
1. Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer:
   - May expose unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and backend servers.
   - Solution: Implement end-to-end encryption or secure channels.

2. Single MySQL Server for Writes:
   - Single point of failure; failure could lead to service disruptions.
   - Solution: Implement MySQL cluster with primary-replica replication.

3. Uniform Server Components:
   - May lead to vulnerabilities across the entire infrastructure.
   - Solution: Diversify server components to minimize risks.
